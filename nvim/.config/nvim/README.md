# My neovim configuration

## Goal

* Make config bloat free.
* Make config reproducible between the machines I work on.
* Make config easily extensible.
* Understand every plug-in that I use and how to extend them.
* Complete development environment for platforms that I work on including the following:
    * LSP
    * Formatting
    * Linting
    * DAP (?!)

## TODO

* ~~Install git signs.~~
* ~~Install null-ls for formatting and linting.~~
* ~~Learn more about vim buffers, windows, tabs, etc. and how to navigate with them.~~
* ~~Use system clipboard for copy+paste.~~
* Understand built in neovim concepts
    * LSP
    * Diagnostics
    * Treesitter
* Understand all installed plugins and what they can do (how to extend them and debug them).
    * nvim-cmp

    * nvim-lsp
    * null-ls
    * luasnip
* Update neovim to see if weird cmp error goes away.
* ~~Consolidate neovim repo and dotfiles repo.~~
* Make sure that lua tools for creating neovim config are all pinned in neovim config.
    * Lua LSP downloaded.
    * Stylua downloaded.
    * Is there a way to pin these packages?
        * Mason downloads, neovim packages
* Start building out python development workflow.
    * LSP with pyright
    * Formatting with black
    * Linting with mypy, pylint, etc.
